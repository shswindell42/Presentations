# Welcome
This is a repo containing presentations I have given over the years. I will keep the code and slides here for future reference and so they are available for folks who have attended my sessions

The presentations are organized into a folder for each presenation with any supporting materials in the folder.

Some presentation are a work in progress and do not contain slides or may only have an abstract. May get around to these someday
